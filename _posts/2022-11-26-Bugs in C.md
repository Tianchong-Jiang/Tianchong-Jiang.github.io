### 2022-11-26 21:00, Parallel Computer hw3b, Spent 2 hrs

There was a segfault. It could appear at several different locations in the dequeue functions and worker function. It does not occur when less than 4 threads are involved.

The cause of the bug was that I wrote:
```C
Lamport_queue_t ** queues = (Lamport_queue_t**)calloc(numSources, sizeof(int));
```
thinking that int and pointers have the same size. However, this is not the case. I am on a 64 bit machine so the size of int is 4 Bytes while the size of pointers is 8 Bytes. I changed the line above to
```C
Lamport_queue_t ** queues = (Lamport_queue_t**)calloc(numSources, sizeof(Lamport_queue_t*));
```
and the problem is fixed. However, it is still unclear why it only appeared in the runs with less than 4 threads.
